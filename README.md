# WorldWise

WorldWise is a ReactJS single-page application (SPA) that allows users to pinpoint and save every place they've been to on an interactive map.

# Features

1. Dynamic Page Navigation: The application employs page navigation that dynamically updates the URL bar as users move between different sections. This creates a true single-page application experience.
2. City and Country Lists: The application provides a list of all visited cities and the corresponding countries, dynamically retrieved and displayed based on user input.
3. Interactive Maps: A map section provides users with the ability to locate their current position using geolocation APIs. Users can also view the cities they have visited as markers on the map.
4. City Details: Clicking on a city marker reveals detailed information about the city, including its name, the date of the visit, personal notes, and even a Wikipedia link for further exploration.
5. User-Friendly UI: The application is designed with a user-friendly interface, making it easy for users to interact with the various features and functionalities.
